                <p>SCENE I (Monsieur Jourdain, Music Master, Dancing Master, Lackeys)</p>

                <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>: That's not all that bad, and those people there
                    hop around well.</p>
               
                  <h6>MUSIC MASTER</h6><p>: When the dance is combined with the music, it will
                    have even better effect, and you will see something quite good in
                    the little ballet we have prepared for you.</p>

                 <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>: That's for later, when the person I ordered all
                    this for is to do me the honor of coming here to dine.
               </p>
               

                <h6>DANCING MASTER</h6><p>>: Everything is ready.</p>
               
                <h6>MUSIC MASTER</h6><p>: However, sir, this is not enough. A person like you,
                    who lives magnificently, and who are inclined towards fine things,
                    should have a concert of music here every Wednesday or every
                    Thursday.</p>

                
                <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>: Is that what people of quality do?</p>
                <h6>MUSIC MASTER</h6><p>: Yes, Sir.</p>
                
                <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>: Then I'll have them. Will it be fine?</p>
                
                <h6>MUSIC MASTER</h6><p>: Without doubt. You must have three voices--a tenor,
                    a soprano, and a bass, who will be accompanied by a bass-viol, a
                    theorbo, and a clavecin for the chords, with two violins to play
                    the ritournelles.</p>
                
                <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>: You must also add a trumpet marine. The trumpet
                    marine is an instrument that pleases me and it's harmonious.</p>
                
                <h6>MUSIC MASTER</h6><p>: Leave it to us to manage things.</p>
                
                <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>: At least, don't forget to send the musicians to
                    sing at table.</p>
                
                <h6>MUSIC MASTER</h6><p>: You will have everything you should have.</p>
                
                <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>: But above all, let the ballet be fine.</p>
                
                <h6>MUSIC MASTER</h6><p>: You will be pleased with it, and, among other things,
                    with certain minuets you will find in it.</p>

                <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>: Ah! Minuets are my dance, and I would like you
                    to see me dance them. Come, my Dancing Master.</p>
                
                <h6>DANCING MASTER</h6><p>: A hat, sir, if you please. La, la, la, la. La, la,
                    la, la. In cadence please. La, la, la, la. Your right leg. La, la,
                    la, la. Don't move your shoulders so. La, la, la, la. Your arms are
                    wrong. La, la, la, la. Raise your head. Turn the toe out.  La, la,
                    la, la. Straighten your body up.
                    </p>
                
                <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>: How was that? (Breathlessly)</p>
                <h6>MUSIC MASTER</h6><p>: The best.</p>
                
                <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>: By the way, teach me how to bow to salute a
                    marchioness; I shall need to know soon.</p>
                
                <h6>DANCING MASTER</h6><p>: How you must bow to salute a marchioness?</p>
                <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>: Yes, a marchioness named Dorimene.</p>
                
               <h6> DANCING MASTER</h6><p>: Give me your hand.</p>
                
                <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>-: No. You only have to do it, I'll remember it
                    well.</p>
               <h6>DANCING MASTER</h6><p>: If you want to salute her with a great deal of
                respect, you must first bow and step back, then bow three times as
                you walk towards her, and at the last one bow down to her knees.</p>
                
                <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6><p>: (After the Dancing Master has illustrated) Do it
                    some. Good!</p>
                
                <h6>LACKEY</h6><p>: Sir, your Fencing Master is here.  MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Tell
                    him to come in here for my lesson. I want you to see me perform.</p>
